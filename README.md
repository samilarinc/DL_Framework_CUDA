# This repository is a Deep Neural Network framework for C++. It is a simple framework that allows you to easily create and train neural networks. <br>
# Convolution and Linear Layers are implemented. <br>
# Loss layers will be implemented soon. <br>
# Optimizers Adam and SGD (supports momentum) are implemented. <br>
# L1 and L2 Regularizations are implemented. <br>
# I am implementing a Neural Network creation tool now. <br>
# All functionality is implemented for CUDA. <br>
# CPU version may be implemented in the future. <br>
# One of the main goals of this project is to bind the whole project to Python for easy usage. <br>
